<p style="font-size: 12px"> Analyzed complex data sets in Python, I identified the busiest days and hours, price ranges and the most popular departments for an online grocery store. I also created customer profiles based on features such as brand loyalty, demographic info, order frequency, family status, regions, and other. On the basis of the analysis results, I gave recommendations to the marketing and sales departments regarding the upcoming marketing campaign to improve customer loyalty and boost sales. </p>
